For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack⁠.</li>\n        <li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples.

This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.</p>\n        <p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.

In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend Resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.

Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save.

Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save.

In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.

Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save.

In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.

Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save.

In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.

Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save.

In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.

Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save.

In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.

Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save.

In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.

Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save.

In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days.
